These set of codes are just work I have done using free data available online.

Feel free to make suggestions!

Project Understat:
Allows you to evaluate which players are the most influential for a team during the calendar year using data from Understat.com.
We will answer the following questions:
1) Who are the 5 most influential players for Goal Events? (Goals + Assists)
2) How is the performance of the 5 most influential players during the season (Month by month and by minutes played)
3) From the player that scores the most: Where does he prefers to shoot and also where does he score the most goals?
4) Who is the best "duo" (Goals and assisted each other the most)

Project_VenezuelavsChile:

I wanted to see if every single player on the Venezuelan's men soccer team touched the ball during the creation of the third goal against Chile. Not only that, but also wanted to see on which side of the field they played the most. I made use of ChatGPT for some areas of the coding process as I was not familiar with some of the technical aspects of recording, but comments of the code and my understanding to what ChatGPT suggested are included.
The 3 movies in this folder are part of this project. Each one with additional items to enhance the understanding of the third goal.
